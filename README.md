### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Nattanicha from North Vancouver. I'm pursuing a Computer Systems Certificate at BCIT, which serves as a stepping stone towards a diploma and a degree in Applied Computer Science. I've successfully completed several projects and assignments, all of which are available on my GitHub profile. Feel free to explore my repositories! Each project is well-documented with DocStrings and comments, and you can find concise descriptions in the README.md files. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
